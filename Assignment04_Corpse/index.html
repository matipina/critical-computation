    Based on Sara's amazing drawing, I wanted to create an exquisite corpse that
    somehow used myself as part of the piece, so I had the idea of using a face tracking
    algorithm to position the head of Sara's original drawing on top of the viewer's, 
    making it so they (and I) are part of the final work.

    This final version is an exploration of the role of the spectator in an art piece, pushing us to take a 
    more active role, since we're literally becoming one with the sketch.
