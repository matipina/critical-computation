      <h1>Description and reflection</h1>
      
      <p>
        My partner, Prakhar, described to me the guitar that he once lost. It was an
        acoustic guitar, whith it's body of a very light brown. The guitar was symetrical 
        and had a rounded shape. He described it using simple language and he didn't give me
        many details, probably due to the fact that most people are familiar with the way that 
        an acoustic guitar looks like, so previouls knowledge was assumed. 
        
        Based on the idea of lost objects and the way that we remember them in ways
        that usually are not very accurate, I wanted to create not <strong>one</strong> guitar,
        but <strong>as many as them as posible</strong>, making multiple variations of one 
        design, with the hopes of helping Prakhar, and whoever is currently reading this,
        to find their own unique guitar.

      <!-- 4. reflection -->

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p>
        I began using only rectangles to sketch my idea. The goal was simple: make a generic guitar.
      </p>

      <div>
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/c4cd17e4-56b9-4fb7-9921-c7dcd8a2f6a2/download%20(1).png?v=1694759339806"
        />
      </div>
      
      <p>
        But as I made progress and completed my first sketch, I inmediately realized that I really
        didn't like the way that the guitar would look if I represent it using a rectangle.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/c4cd17e4-56b9-4fb7-9921-c7dcd8a2f6a2/download%20(2).png?v=1694759347272"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        For that reason, I decided to challenge myself and use bezier curves to make the body of the guitar
        look more realistic. These kind of curves (and curves in general in p5.js) are hard to work with,
        since they are not very intuitive, so this was probably the hardest part of the process. I created
        a couple of auxiliary functions (buttons for grid and anchor points) that would help me understand the 
        way that these curves worked. A few mistakes while doing these actually ended up looking pretty interesting.
           
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/c4cd17e4-56b9-4fb7-9921-c7dcd8a2f6a2/mistake01.png?v=1694759358810"
        />
      </div>
      
      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.global/c4cd17e4-56b9-4fb7-9921-c7dcd8a2f6a2/mistake2.png?v=1694759363222"
        />
      </div>
      
      Finally, I coded a guitar editor using sliders to control the different anchor points that gave the guitar's 
      body its shape.
      
      All that was left was to randomize the creation of these guitars. Also, at the end, a few lucky errors allowed
      me to include a couple of fun features ;)
